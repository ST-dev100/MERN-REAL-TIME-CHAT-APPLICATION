# MERN Stack REAL-TIME-CHAT-APPLICATION

This project is a simple realtime chat application developed using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js. In addition to the MERN stack, it also utilizes Socket.io for real-time communication between users. The frontend of the application is designed using DIsyUI for a clean and modern user interface, while Tailwind CSS is used for styling and layout. Users can sign up, log in, and chat with others in real-time, making it a seamless and engaging experience. This project showcases the power and flexibility of the MERN stack and how additional tools like Socket.io and Tailwind CSS can enhance the functionality and design of the application.
